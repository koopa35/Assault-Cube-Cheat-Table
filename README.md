# Assault-Cube-Cheat-Table
A quick Assault Cube cheat table that I made while trying to learn the basics of memory manipulation, feel free to edit it and build your own based off of it.
To Run this you need to have two things installed:
  -cheat engine
  -assault cube
  
 Once those Two are installed you can load the file ac_client into cheat engine and then ur good
